# Sunset Animations App  :sunrise:
An app designed to display animations based on different weather effects.

## Project Motivation
Created as a working project for an Independant study in Hybrid-Mobile App Development that took place from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018. 

## Tools used in the development of this project  :wrench:
- <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic 2</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io">Angular 2</a>

# Project Dependencies
#### I recommend reading all documentation about installation and dependencies before beginning installation.
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup">Angular 2 and dependencies (node.js, npm, RxJS)</a>
- <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/installation.html">Ionic 2 and dependencies (Apache ANT, Java, Android SDK, Cordova)</a>

## Running the project
After cloning the repository, change your current working directory to that of the repository using the 
command `cd sunset-animation-app`

Then run `npm install` to install the rest of the project dependencies. (This will take a minute or two). 
The result will be a large folder called 'node_modules' appearing in your repository.

Finally run `ionic serve`. This will run the app and display it in a browser window.
When the page when it loads you will need to right click and select 'Inspect', 
then click on the 'Toggle device toolbar' button directly to the right of your 'Elements' header. 
This will allow you to emulate the resolution and aspect ratio of multiple device types and allow you to more 
accurately display the application.
